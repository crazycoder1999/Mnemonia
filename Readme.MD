#Before use the Code:
Mnemonia is an application for BlackBerry10: a client for Pocket/ReadItLater service.

I started this app more than 3 years ago, to learn how to develop native QML/C++ app for BB10.

When I started this application I missed a pocket/readitlater app.. so I built one :)

It was a sideproject made for fun and make practice with the platform

**Read the disclaimer: it is important!**

#Disclaimer: 
- The code has never been refactored 
- The code is old and I didn't test it
- The app has been developed in my free time(weekend and night mainly): just for fun!
- It contains "spaghetti code" 
- The code can contains bugs: I'm sorry
- The code is free: use it, change it, do whatever you want with it
- Any ideas, considerations about the code is WELL appreciated: feel free to write me
- This is not a case study on how to build a solid blackberry10 native app , but it can be useful to getting started with the platform

#why?
- I didn't have more time to improve the app
- I think someone will appreciate this code 
- It's better to share it with the community instead of leave it on my hard drive

#In order to use the code and build a working app:
- search and change CONSUMER_KEY value, with a valid value: one you can create from the developer page of pocket (in BlackSound.cpp is 12345678901234567890 right now)
- change the url for the AUTH in the requests  (search http://www.yourwebpagetoconfirmisok.com/ok.html in BlackSound.cpp) and use the same url on pocket

**OR**: simply search for the **CHANGE HERE** string in BlackSound.cpp

#Thanks to:
- BlackBerry: for the effort to developers, it was incredible at the launch of BB10! 
- Thanks to BlackBerry10 engineers for the awesome operating system they have created: I'm addicted. A really good system: fast and reliable. I'm definetly an happy user and I understand the new android choice... but I'm still a lover of BB10 :)
- The BlackBerry Developer Community!
